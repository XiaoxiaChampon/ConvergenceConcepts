# Motivation

A [Pew Research Center survey of 10,701 U.S. adults was conducted in March 2023](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/05/16/americans-largely-positive-views-of-childhood-vaccines-hold-steady/). The survey asked participants questions related to their thoughts on vaccination. One question centered around the perceived efficacy of the MMR vaccine.

<div style = "float:right">
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "400px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/pew.jpg")
```
</div>

The Center survey finds 88% of Americans say the benefits of childhood vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) outweigh the risks, compared with just 10% who say the risks outweigh the benefits.

The sample proportion of 0.88 is an estimate of the population proportion. That is, the actual proportion of U.S. adults that believe the benefits outweigh the risks. 

Of course this is a single number estimate that would change if we sampled again. We can report the standard deviation of this sample proportion, called a standard error, to give us an idea of the variability in the estimate.  

Assuming independence between study participants, we can find an estimated standard error for this sample proportion using techniques learned eariler:

$$\widehat{SE(\hat{p})} = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{0.88*0.12}{10701}} = 0.0031$$
Two big questions arise:

- First, can we provide a range of values we are 'confident' the true proportion falls in?
    + We need to know about more than just the variability of the estimator
    + We need to understand the **distribution** of the estimator!
        - Called the **sampling distribution**
        - Describes the pattern in which we observe this $\hat{p}$
    + The sampling distribution can be difficult to derive in some cases!
- Second, ideally we'd like for our estimator to get closer to the true proportion for larger sample sizes
    + Is there a value that $\hat{p}$ *converges* to as n grows?
    + What does it even mean for a random quantity to converge?
    
These two questions can often be answered by looking at the *limiting* behavior (here as the sample size grows) of the estimator $\hat{p}$.


## Convergence in Distribution Idea

To answer the first question, let's consider determining the sampling distribution through simulation. A distribution just describes the pattern in which we observe our variable. If we can simulate observing the variable, we can create many *realizations* of $\hat{p}$ to understand the sampling distribution. 

To do this we need to make some assumptions. We need to assume a true $p$ and a sample size $n$. Let's use the app below to consider the sampling distribution when $p$ is 0.9 and $n$ is 100. **Add instructions on what to do here**

-Instructions:


    -"n: sample size" Slider: Move the  slider to the right to increase the sample size
  
    -"p: true value in population" Slider: Move the  slider to the right to increase the true proportion

    - Action Button: Click on the "Generate 100 sample proportions" button to view the results for 100 samples
  
    -Check box: Check the "Add +/- 2 Standard Errors and Overlay Smoothed Density" check box to add standard errors

    ),
    mainPanel(
      plotOutput("samp_dist")
    )
  ),
  server <- function(input, output, session){
      ys <- reactiveValues(y = c(), n = 0)

      observeEvent(input$gen, 
                   {
                     ys$y <- c(ys$y, rbinom(1, size = input$sample_size, prob = input$true_p))
                     ys$n <- ys$n + 1
                     }
                   )
      
      observeEvent(input$gen100, 
                   {
                     ys$y <- c(ys$y, rbinom(100, size = input$sample_size, prob = input$true_p))
                     ys$n <- ys$n + 100
                     }
       )
      
      observeEvent(c(input$sample_size, input$true_p), 
                   {
                     ys$y <- c()
                     ys$n <- 0
                     }
                   )
            
      output$samp_dist <- renderPlot({
        props <- ys$y/input$sample_size
        if(length(props) > 0) {
          hist(props, 
               xlab = "Sample Proportions", 
               main = paste0("Sampling Distribution of p-hat\n# of sample proportions plotted: ", ys$n),
               freq = FALSE)
          if(input$bars){
            se <- sqrt(input$true_p*(1-input$true_p)/input$sample_size)
            bounds <- c(input$true_p - 2*se, input$true_p + 2*se)
            abline(v = bounds, col = "red", lwd = 2)
            
            text(x = input$true_p + 0.5*se, y = 2, labels = paste0(round(mean(props <= bounds[2] & props >= bounds[1]), 2), " of the distribution\nbetween the bars"))
            lines(density(props, kernel = "gaussian", adjust = 2))
          }
        } else {
          NULL
        }
      })
  }
)
```

As long as the distribution is roughly normal, we can see that 0.95 of the distribution falls within two standard errors of $p$. This means we could use something like 

$$\hat{p}\pm 2*\widehat{SE(\hat{p})}$$

as an interval to *capture* the true $p$. (Indeed this is the usual basic interval for a proportion!)


## Convergence in Probability Idea

To answer the second question, we could consider generating sample proportions for ever increasing values of the sample size and seeing how they behave. Below generate sample proportions and subtract off the true value of $p$, plotting those differences. **Add in instructions**

-Instructions:

    -Numeric Input for "Maximum Sample Size": Enter a number or click the "up"/"down" arrow to to increase/decrease the sample size from the default sample size 250
    -"# samples at each n" Slider: Move the slider to the right to increase the true proportion
    -Action Button: Click on the "Generate a sample proportion" button to view the result for one sample
    -Action Button: Click on the "Generate 100 sample proportions" button to view the results for 100 samples
    -Check box: Check the "Add +/- 2 Standard Errors and Overlay Smoothed Density" check box to add standard errors

```{r, echo = FALSE}
shinyApp(
  ui <- fluidPage(
    #inputs on the side for n, p, and generating data
    sidebarPanel(
      numericInput("max_size",
                   "Maximum Sample Size",
                   value = 250,
                   min = 10, 
                   max = 5000),
      sliderInput("num_samples",
                  "# samples at each n",
                  min = 1,
                  max = 10,
                  step= 1,
                  value = 1),
      sliderInput("true_p",
                  "p: true value in population",
                  min = 0,
                  max = 1,
                  step= 0.01,
                  value = 0.5),
      actionButton("create",
                   "Create/Update graph")
    ),
    mainPanel(
      plotOutput("convergence")
    )
  ),
  server <- function(input, output, session){
      ps <- reactiveValues(p = c())

      observeEvent(input$create, 
                   {
                     ps$p <- sapply(1:input$max_size, FUN = function(x){
                       rbinom(n = input$num_samples, 
                              size = x,
                              prob = input$true_p)/x
                       })
                     }
                   )
            
      output$convergence <- renderPlot({
        props <- ps$p
        truth <- isolate(input$true_p)
        num <- isolate(input$num_samples)
        max_size <- isolate(input$max_size)
        ep <- 0.05
        if(length(props) == 0) {
          plot(x = NULL, 
               y = NULL, 
               xlim = c(0, max_size), 
               ylim = c(-0.5, 0.5),
               xlab = "Sample Size",
               ylab = "phat-p",
               main = "Plot of sample proportion minus the true proportion\nRed lines indicate +/- 0.05")
          abline(h = c(-ep, ep), col = "red", lwd = 2)
        } else {
          plot(x = rep(1:max_size, each = num), y = c(props)-truth, 
               main = "Plot of sample proportion minus the true proportion\nRed lines indicate +/- 0.05",
               xlab = "Sample Size",
               ylab = "phat - p",
               type = "p")
          abline(h = c(-ep, ep), col = "red", lwd = 2)
        }
      })
  }
)
```

We can see that $\hat{p}-p$ seems to get closer to 0. This indicates that $\hat{p}$ is in some sense *converging* to the true value of $p$!

Now that we some basic intution, let's formalize what we are talking about.

# What is Limit Theory?

By limit, large-sample, or asymptotic theory we mean we want to understand the behavior of some quantity, usually a statistic, as something changes, usually the sample size $n$. For instance, we will investigate the behavior of the sample mean, $\bar{Y}$, as the sample size grows. We'll look at questions like:

- When the distribution of a statistic (called a **sampling distribution**) is difficult to derive *exactly*, is there a good **approximating** distribution that can be used to get **approximate** probability statements about $\bar{Y}$?
- What value does $\bar{Y}$ *get close to* or *converge* to as the sample size grows? 

Answers to these questions will allows us to do inference (confidence intervals and hypothesis tests) and understand how well we are estimating a quantity, respectively.

## Common Assumptions & Definitions

We must make some assumptions about how we observe our random variables in order to investigate these types of questions. For simplicity, we often assume we have a **random sample**.

Random Sample
: $Y_1,..., Y_n$ are a random sample (RS) of size $n$ if the random variables are independent and identically distributed (iid). 

We'll often say 'assume we have a random sample' from some distribution or that 'our random variables are iid' from some distribution. These are equivalent ways of stating this assumption.

For the proportion example above we might formally state our assumption as follows:

- Define $X_i = \begin{cases} 1 & \mbox{if the }i^{th}\mbox{ individual says the benefits of childhood vaccines for MMR outweigh the risks}\\ 0 & \mbox{if not}\end{cases}$
- Then $X_i\stackrel{iid}\sim Ber(p)$ where $p$ represents the true proportion of people in the U.S. that believe the benefits outweight the risks
- The random variable $Y = \sum_{i=1}^{n}X_i \sim Bin(n,p)$
- We then often try to use $Y$ or $\hat{p}=Y/n$ to make inference on $p$. $Y$ and $\hat{p}$ are referred to as **statistics**. Note: $\hat{p}$ is also $\bar{X}$!

Statistic
: A function of $Y_1,Y_2,...,Y_n$ from a random sample that does not involve any unknown parameters is called a statistic.

Commonly studied statistics:  

- $\bar{Y} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i$
- $S^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_i-\bar{Y})^2$
- $Y_{(n)} = \mbox{the maximum value from the sample}$

Quantities that aren't statistics:  

- $\frac{\bar{Y}-\mu}{S/\sqrt{n}}$ (since $\mu$ is unknown - if we assume $\mu$ is known (like when we do a test statistic) then this is a statistic)
- $\frac{(n-1)S^2}{\sigma^2}$ (since $\sigma^2$ is unknown)

One type of convergence we'll look at is focused on the pattern in which these statistics are observed, that is, the **sampling distribution** of the statistics.

Recall that a distribution is just the pattern and frequency with which we observe a random variable. With a statistic, we give this distribution the special name of sampling distribution. This is because we can think of how that distribution is formed by considering repeated samples from the population, each sample producing the statistic of interest.

Sampling Distribution
: The distribution of a statistic is called a sampling distribution.

**Put a gif of a sampling distribution being built by adding values using the binomial p-hat example. Sample size of n = 40 with p = 0.25 or something like that. Very skinny bars so they can see the discrete nature with a normal distribution overlay. The gif should add say 500 values of p-hat over 5 seconds or so.**

**I've put the code you used for a gif here below. I would not have the code evaluate at run time but produce an output .gif with the anim_save() you had. Then just load that gif in. I've streamlined your code for the gamma example below. This code won't work for what goes here but perhaps can be used later!**

# Convergence in Distribution 

We saw that the distribution of $\hat{p}$ seemed to look like a bell curve for some combinations of $n$ and $p$. If we fix a $p$ and increase $n$, we will start to see a bell shape for large enough $n$! Later we'll see that a good **large-sample** distribution for $\hat{p}$ is the Normal distribution with mean $p$ and variance $p(1-p)/n$.  

We can see that there may be a distinction between the *actual* distribution, which is a discrete distribution for $\hat{p}$, and an approximating distribution, the Normal distribution for $\hat{p}$. We call these by different names.

Exact Distribution
: The (sampling) distribution of a quantity that is valid for any sample size (or, occasionally, values of the parameters of the population distribution).

Large-Sample or Approximate Distribution
: A (sampling) distribution that is reasonable to use for a quantity for a *large* sample size (or occasionally other parameter values). 

We use the notation
$$Statistic \stackrel{\bullet}\sim f$$
to denote a large-sample approximating distribution.

In the sample proportion example, we would write

$$\hat{p}\stackrel{\bullet}\sim N(p, p(1-p)/n)$$

While this idea can be visually inspected with a histogram, formally we define **convergence in distribution** using the cumulative distribution function or CDF.

Let's formally define convergence in distribution! Recall the Cumulative Distribution Function (or CDF) of a random variable $Y$ is defined as 

$$F_Y(y) = P(Y\leq y)$$

Convergence in Distribution
: The quantity $Y_n$ converges in distribution to $Y$ if
$$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} F_{Y_n}(y)=F_{Y}(y)$$
or equivalently
$$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} |F_{Y_n}(y)-F_{Y}(y)|=0$$
(at all points $y$ where $F_Y(y)$ is continuous). We denote this as
$$Y_n\stackrel{d}\rightarrow Y$$

For example, given a random sample from a distribution with finite variance, 
$$Z_n = \frac{\bar{Y}_n - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}$$
can be shown to converge in distribution to a standard normal distribution. This means that
$$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} F_{Z_n}(z)=F_{Z}(z)$$
where $Z\sim N(0,1)$.

Note: Here the subscript $n$ is just to explicitly note the dependence of the quantity on the sample size. We could leave that off if we'd like.

## Convergence in Distribution Example

- Suppose that $Y_i\stackrel{iid}\sim U(0,1)$. That is,

From above, let $\epsilon= \frac{t}{n}$, 

then $P(X(n)≤1−\frac{t}{n})=(1−\frac{t}{n})^n \rightarrow e^{−t}$. 

$P(n(1−X(n))≤t) \rightarrow 1−e^{−t}$, the random variable $n (1−X(n))$ converges to exponential(1).


## Convergence Exploration

- Suppose that $Y_i\stackrel{iid}\sim Gamma(\alpha, \lambda)$. That is, assume we have a random sample from a Gamma distribution with PDF
$$f_Y(y) = \frac{\lambda^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)}y^{\alpha -1}e^{-\lambda y}$$
with mean $E(Y) = \alpha/\lambda$ and variance $Var(Y) = \alpha/\lambda^2$.
- Consider the statistic $\bar{Y} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i$. 
- The sampling distribution of this statistic can often be well approximated using a Normal distribution. Consider changes to $\alpha$, $\lambda$, and $n$ using the app below. 
- Can you develop a rule of thumb around $\alpha$, $\lambda$, and $n$ for when a Normal distribution may be a reasonable approximation?  Remember we look for the following in each graph:  
    + Histogram: when does it become a symmetric bell-shape?
    + CDF comparison: When do the CDFs essentially overlap? (**Note: We know the result here and are using that here or something clearer than that**)
    + Absolute difference in CDFs: When do the differences get small?

## Central Limit Theorem

One of the most important theorems in statistics is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). The CLT gives us a general result about the large-sample behavior of a sample mean.

CLT
: Suppose that $Y_i\stackrel{iid}\sim f_Y$ where $E(Y)=\mu$ and $Var(Y)=\sigma^2 < \infty$.  Define $\bar{Y}=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i$ and $Z \sim N(0, 1)$
$$\frac{\bar{Y}-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} \stackrel {d} {\rightarrow} Z$$

Practically, we can say that a good approximating distribution or large-sample distribution for $\bar{Y}$ is
$$\bar{Y}\stackrel{\bullet}\sim N(\mu, \sigma^2/n)$$

## CLT Applied to the Gamma Example

**Apply to the gamma distribution example**

For example, if $Y_i\stackrel{iid}\sim Gamma(\alpha, \lambda)$ with mean $E(Y) = \alpha/\lambda$ and variance $Var(Y) = \alpha/\lambda^2$.

Then $\bar{Y}$ is
$$\bar{Y}\stackrel{\bullet}\sim N(\alpha/\lambda, \alpha/\lambda^2n)$$


## CLT Applied to a Sample Proportion

A common application of the CLT is to the sample proportion from a Binomial experiment.

**Apply CLT to the sample proportion**

For example, if $Y_i\stackrel{iid}\sim Bin(n, p)$ with mean $E(Y) = np$ and variance $Var(Y) = np(1-p)$. 

Then $X=\frac{Y}{n}$ has mean $E(X) = p$ and variance $Var(X) = p(1-p)/n$

So ${X}$ is
$${X}\stackrel{\bullet}\sim N(p, p(1-p)/n)$$

**Now let them explore the CLT on a sample proportion with app. Ask for rules of thumb or if they know rules of thumb, to justify them.**

## CLT Applied to a Sum 

Recall the result: 

- If $X\sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ then $aX+b\sim N(a\mu+b,a^2\sigma^2)$
- A Normal random variable multiplied by a constant is still Normally distributed, just with a different mean and variance. 
- This implies we can find a good large-sample distribution for a summation when the CLT is applicable!

Under the same assumptions as the CLT, since $n\bar{Y} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}Y_i$ we have the following result:
$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i \stackrel{\bullet}{\sim}N(n\mu, n\sigma^2)$$

**Apply CLT to sum of iid gammas. Show how it can be used to show convergence of a gamma to a normal as $\alpha$ grows**

## Example CLT on a Sum Applied to the Binomial

**Quick exercise, apply CLT on sum to binomial**

Practically, why is the CLT so important?

- Suppose we know $\sigma$ and we want inference for $\mu$.
- If we get a RS $Y_1,...,Y_n$ we know  $\bar{Y}\stackrel{\bullet}{\sim}N(\mu,\sigma^2/n)$ ($\mu$ only unknown)
- We can make an approximate claim about $\mu$ via a confidence interval
$$P(-1.96<Z<1.96)=0.95 \Leftrightarrow 
	P\left(-1.96<\frac{\bar{Y}-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}<1.96\right)=0.95$$
$$\Leftrightarrow P\left(\bar{Y}-1.96\sigma/\sqrt{n}<\mu<\bar{Y}+1.96\sigma/\sqrt{n}\right)=0.95$$
- That is, there is a 95\% probability the RVs 
$\bar{Y}-1.96\sigma/\sqrt{n}$ and $\bar{Y}+1.96\sigma/\sqrt{n}$ capture $\mu$.
- Observe $\bar{Y}=\bar{y}$, get observed CI.  Range we are `confident' contains $\mu$.
- Note: No assumption about $Y$'s distribution made other than finite variance!


# Convergence in Probability Definition 

A sequence of RVs $Y_1,...,Y_n,...$ converges in probability to a RV $Y$ if for every $\epsilon>0$
$$lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}P(|Y_n-Y|\geq \epsilon)=0 \iff 
lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}P(|Y_n-Y|<\epsilon)=1$$
Denoted by $Y_n\stackrel{p}{\rightarrow}Y$.  \\

We'll mostly care about convergence in probability to a constant, call it $c$.
$$lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}P(|Y_n-c|< \epsilon)=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}P(-\epsilon < Y_n-c<\epsilon) =  \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}P(c-\epsilon < Y_n<c+\epsilon)=1$$

Convergence in probability idea - We will show that for a RS where the 
mean and variance exist the sequence 
$$\bar{Y}=\bar{Y}_{n}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}Y_i\stackrel{p}\rightarrow 
E(Y)=\mu$$

##Convergence in probability idea

We will investigate the process of $X_n\stackrel{p}{\rightarrow}0$, where $X_1, X_2, X_3,..., X_n$ are a sequence of $iid$ random variables that $X_n=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}Y_i}{n^2}$ and $Y_i\sim N(0,1)$.\\

- $n$ is the number of points in each sample path

- Probability=$\frac{number \lvert X_n-0\rvert \geq \epsilon}{M}$ for each column

##Details:  How do we prove convergence in probability?

-Markov's Inequality 
 * If $X$ is a nonnegative RV (support has no negative values) for which $E(X)$ exists, then for $t>0$
$$P(X\geq t)\leq \frac{E(X)}{t}$$

Example: If $X\sim exp(1)$ then $P(X\geq t)=e^{-t}$ and $E(X)/t=1/t$.

Chebychev's Inequality 

 Let $X$ be a RV with mean = $\mu$ and variance = $\sigma^2$, then for $t>0$ 
$$P(|X-\mu|\geq t)\leq \frac{\sigma^2}{t^2}$$

Example:  If $t=\sigma k$ for $k>0$, we can apply Chebychev's to get
$$P\left(|X-\mu|\geq k\sigma\right)\leq \frac{\sigma^2}{k^2\sigma^2}=\frac{1}{k^2}$$
For $k=2$ we have $P\left(|X-\mu|\geq 2\sigma\right)\leq 1/4$.


- At least 75\% of a RVs distribution lies within 2 standard deviations of the mean (if these moments exist)
- Regardless of distribution! (if moments exist)
- If $X\sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ we know $P(|X-\mu|\geq 2\sigma)\approx 0.05$. The bound isn't always very tight!




## Relating the inequalities to convergence in probability

Weak Law of Large Numbers (WLLN) 

- If $Y_1,Y_2,...$ is a sequence of independent RVs with $E(Y_i)=\mu$, $Var(Y_i)=\sigma^2$ then $\bar{Y}_{n}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}Y_i\stackrel{p}{\rightarrow}\mu$


#Very powerful result!


- Big picture goal is to estimate parameters such as $\mu$.
- If we get a RS we know that $\bar{Y}$ will be a `close' to $\mu$ for `large' samples.


Example: $Y_i\stackrel{iid}{\sim}f_Y(y)$ where $E(Y_i^2)$ exists ($E\left(|Y_i^2|\right)<\infty$) then $Y_i^2$ are independent and all have the same expectation!

Example: If $Y_i\stackrel{iid}\sim f_Y(y)$ with $E(Y)=\mu$ and 
$Var(Y)=\sigma^2$ then 

##Continuity Theorem (works for all three types of convergence) 
- If $Y_1,Y_2,Y_3,...$ converge to $Y$ and $g$ is a continuous function then 
$g(Y_1),g(Y_2),g(Y_3)...$ converge to $g(Y)$. 

Example: Suppose $Y_i$ are independent each with mean $\mu$, we have interest 
in $\mu^2$.


A sequence of RVs $Y_1,...,Y_n,...$ converges in probability to a RV $Y$ if for every $\epsilon>0$
$$lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}P(|Y_n-Y|\geq \epsilon)=0 \iff 
lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}P(|Y_n-Y|<\epsilon)=1$$
Denoted by $Y_n\stackrel{p}{\rightarrow}Y$.  \\

We'll mostly care about convergence in probability to a constant, call it $c$.
$$lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}P(|Y_n-c|< \epsilon)=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}P(-\epsilon < Y_n-c<\epsilon) =  \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}P(c-\epsilon < Y_n<c+\epsilon)=1$$


Other standard limit results exist such as
$$\mbox{If }Y\stackrel{p}{\rightarrow}\theta, 
X\stackrel{p}{\rightarrow}\lambda\mbox{ then }Y\pm 
X\stackrel{p}{\rightarrow}\theta\pm\lambda$$
